\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Problem}Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar with an Atom or RSS feed).  It should be on a topic or topics of which you are  qualified to provide classification training data.  Find something with at least 100 entries. Create between four and eight different categories for the entries in the feed. Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 class slides.

\subsection{Response}For our blog, we chose Jingle Bell Junction (\url{http://jinglebelljunction.com/}), which is self-described as ``the merriest Christmas site on the web!'' The content of the blogs and downloads consist of holiday recipes, news \& articles, crafts, homemade gift ideas, and various other Christmas-related topics. After reviewing the blogs, we chose the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item recipe;
\item craft;
\item activity;
\item gift idea; and
\item news article.
\end{itemize}
To ensure consistency as we are attempting to classify the entries, the RSS feed was downloaded to an XML file (i.e., jinglebell.xml). The XML file is included in the supporting documents for this assignment.

\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Problem}Manually classify the first 50 entries, and then classify (using the fisher classifier) the remaining 50 entries. Report the cprob() values for the 50 titles as well.  From the title or entry itself, specify the 1-, 2-, or 3-gram that you used for the string to classify.  Do not repeat strings; you will have 50 unique strings. Create a table with the title, the string used for classification, cprob(), predicted category, and actual category.
\subsection{Response}We used the \emph{docclass.py} and \emph{feedfilter.py} files found in Segaran \cite{segaran2007programming} as the basis for our document filtering. The modified source code, shown in Appendices \ref{chap:pythona} and \ref{chap:pythonb}, performs the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use \emph{docclass.py} to extract features from the title and summary from the first 50 entries in the RSS feed. 
\item Remove all HTML tags before dividing the remaining text of each entry into individual words.
\item Manually train the classifier using the Fisher method. Save the features and related categories to a set of database tables so the training will persist between sessions.
\item Use \emph{feedfilter.py} to parse the title and summary of the RSS feed for the remaining 50 entries.
\item Use the Fisher method to predict a category based on the entry.
\item Prompt the user to enter the actual category along with an n-gram to determine the Fisher probability (i.e. cprob()).
\item Save the entry title, feature (i.e., n-gram), predicted category, actual category, and cprob() to database table.
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:training} shows the number of entries that were allocated to each of defined categories while training the classifier.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|r|}
    \hline
    Category & Entries \\ \hline
    craft    & 15    \\ \hline
    recipe   & 4     \\ \hline
    activity & 11    \\ \hline
    news     & 14    \\ \hline
    gift     & 6     \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption {Entries per Training Category}
			\label{tab:training}
\end{table}

The results of classifying the Jingle Bell Junction RSS feed are shown in Table \ref{tab:results}. Based on the overwhelming number of predictions rated at 0 probability, we can conclude the classifier did not perform well on this particular data set. As stated in Segaran \cite{segaran2007programming}, this might be attributed to the unequal number of documents allocated to each category during training. We can see from Table \ref{tab:training} that blogs on the Jingle Bell Junction web site skew more heavily towards news articles and craft ideas.

\section{Question 3}
\subsection{Problem}Assess the performance of your classifier in each of your categories by computing precision and recall.  Note that the definitions are slightly different in the context of classification; see: \small\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Definition_.28classification_context.29}\par
\subsection{Response}Since our data is classified using multiple categories, we will use a confusion matrix (\small\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix}) to analyze the results and calculate precision and recall. The matrix as shown in Table \ref{tab:confusion} will illustrate how well the classifier was able to make the correct predictions. Based on the entries in the confusion matrix, we can also compute precision and recall as shown in Table \ref{tab:performance}.  If we use 50\% as the threshold above which our classifier performs well, then the precision for recipes, crafts, and gifts would be considered acceptable. For document relevance, only the recall levels for recipes and news articles would be considered acceptable. Overall, this classifier works best with documents in the news category. This may be attibutable to the fact that these types of entries tend to have more features (i.e., words) than other categories, such as a recipe.
